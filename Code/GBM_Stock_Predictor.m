%% As we notice from the plot, as the value of sigma changes from 0.5 to 0.01, the deviations of the stock decreases as the volatility decreases and hence the fluctuations in the values of the stock decreases. 

%% We also notice on changing the mu values the amplitude of the stock increases, hence the maximum value of the stock throughout the trading period increases.
